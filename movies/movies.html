                    <p>    One of the first films wasn't even intended to be entertaining. Instead, it was created to solve a simple scientific question presented by racehorse owner Leland Stanford: Do the four hooves of a galloping horse ever leave the ground? This short film was created by Eadweard Muybridge, a visionary. He would go on to have a successful career in film producing. Muybridge arranged for numerous cameras to go off at the same time to capture a horse's gallop in order to discover the truth. After that, he put all of the collected photos together to make the first moving picture. While this strategy is simple to do now, it was revolutionary at the time. The Horse in Motion was the name given to the project (1878). The film not only answered Stanford's question (yes! ), but it also opened the door for numerous silent motion picture films to follow.</p>

                    <p>    Cinema was not created by a single person. The Edison Company, on the other hand, successfully showed a prototype of the Kinetoscope in 1891, which allowed one person to view moving pictures at a time. In 1893, the first public Kinetoscope demonstration was held. The Kinetoscope had become a commercial success by 1894, with public parlors springing up all over the world. The Lumière brothers were the first to show projected moving pictures to a paying audience in December 1895 in Paris, France. They employed a gadget they invented called the Cinématographe, which had a camera, projector, and film printer all in one unit.</p>

                    <p>    Hand coloring, tinting, toning, and stenciling were the first ways to add color to black-and-white films. The British Kinemacolor technique, first shown to the public in 1909, employed color separation principles to create so-called "natural color" moving films by 1906. Kinemacolor was largely employed for documentary (or "truth") films, such as the 1912 epic With Our King and Queen Through India (also known as The Delhi Durbar), which lasted over 2 hours. The early Technicolor processes from 1915 onwards were cumbersome and expensive, and colour was not used more widely until the introduction of its three‑colour process in 1932. It was used for films such as Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz (both 1939) in Hollywood and A Matter of Life and Death (1946) in the UK.</p>

                    <p>The Handschiegl color process created motion picture film prints with color added to specific portions of the image artificially. Gelatin imbibition matrices were used to apply aniline colors to a black-and-white print.</p>

                    <p>Keller-Dorian cinematography was a 1920s French technology for recording color movies that used a lenticular process to isolate red, green, and blue colors and record them on a single black-and-white frame. Keller-Dorian was primarily a paper and aluminum foil maker (tin foil). [1] It received a total of 38 patents. [2] They came into this cinematography approach while investigating how to make dies to color aluminum foil. This is different from other color systems, like as Technicolor, which separated the colors into many frames on one or more pieces of film.</p>
